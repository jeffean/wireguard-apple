# [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) for iOS and macOS

This project contains an application for iOS and for macOS, as well as many components shared between the two of them. You may toggle between the two platforms by selecting the target from within Xcode.

## Building

- Clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-apple
$ cd wireguard-apple
```

- Rename and populate developer team ID file:

```
$ cp Sources/WireGuardApp/Config/Developer.xcconfig.template Sources/WireGuardApp/Config/Developer.xcconfig
$ vim Sources/WireGuardApp/Config/Developer.xcconfig
```

- Install swiftlint and go 1.19:

```
$ brew install swiftlint go
```

- Open project in Xcode:

```
$ open WireGuard.xcodeproj
```

- Flip switches, press buttons, and make whirling noises until Xcode builds it.

## iOS Home Screen Widget

The iOS app includes small and medium Home Screen widgets. On iOS 16 and
later it also offers circular, rectangular, and inline Lock Screen widgets.
Each widget shows the current tunnel state as Connected, Connecting,
Disconnecting, or Disconnected. It also shows the tunnel name while a tunnel
is active or changing state. While connected, the widget shows a live uptime
timer that counts from the last time the shared snapshot changed to Connected.
If the Network Extension stops without publishing a final state, the widget
keeps the last published state until the app or extension publishes again.

The app and Network Extension publish a shared status snapshot when the tunnel
state changes. A changed snapshot requests a WidgetKit timeline reload.
WidgetKit controls the reload schedule and may delay, combine, or throttle
requests. State changes are not guaranteed to appear in the widget
immediately.

The iOS app, Network Extension, and Widget Extension must use the same
registered App Group. The default identifier is `group.$(APP_ID_IOS)`. Enable
this App Group for all three App IDs in the Apple Developer portal, then
regenerate the related provisioning profiles. Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and
`APP_ID_IOS` in `Sources/WireGuardApp/Config/Developer.xcconfig` before
building.

An unsigned simulator build verifies that the Widget Extension compiles and is
embedded in the iOS app. It does not verify App Group access, provisioning, or
WidgetKit reload behavior. Test those requirements with a signed build on a
real device before release.

## WireGuardKit integration

1. Open your Xcode project and add the Swift package with the following URL:
   
   ```
   https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-apple
   ```
   
2. `WireGuardKit` links against `wireguard-go-bridge` library, but it cannot build it automatically
   due to Swift package manager limitations. So it needs a little help from a developer. 
   Please follow the instructions below to create a build target(s) for `wireguard-go-bridge`.
   
   - In Xcode, click File -> New -> Target. Switch to "Other" tab and choose "External Build 
     System".
   - Type in `WireGuardGoBridge<PLATFORM>` under the "Product name", replacing the `<PLATFORM>` 
     placeholder with the name of the platform. For example, when targeting macOS use `macOS`, or 
     when targeting iOS use `iOS`.
     Make sure the build tool is set to: `/usr/bin/make` (default).
   - In the appeared "Info" tab of a newly created target, type in the "Directory" path under 
     the "External Build Tool Configuration":
     
     ```
     ${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}SourcePackages/checkouts/wireguard-apple/Sources/WireGuardKitGo
     ```
     
   - Switch to "Build Settings" and find `SDKROOT`.
     Type in `macosx` if you target macOS, or type in `iphoneos` if you target iOS.
   
3. Go to Xcode project settings and locate your network extension target and switch to 
   "Build Phases" tab.
   
   - Locate "Dependencies" section and hit "+" to add `WireGuardGoBridge<PLATFORM>` replacing 
     the `<PLATFORM>` placeholder with the name of platform matching the network extension 
     deployment target (i.e macOS or iOS).
     
   - Locate the "Link with binary libraries" section and hit "+" to add `WireGuardKit`.
   
4. In Xcode project settings, locate your main bundle app and switch to "Build Phases" tab. 
   Locate the "Link with binary libraries" section and hit "+" to add `WireGuardKit`.
   
5. iOS only: Locate Bitcode settings under your application target, Build settings -> Enable Bitcode, 
   change the corresponding value to "No".
   
Note that if you ship your app for both iOS and macOS, make sure to repeat the steps 2-4 twice, 
once per platform.
